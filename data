1. Downloading the Dataset
The dataset consists of high-resolution video files, making direct processing difficult. Instead of working with the entire dataset, we:

Downloaded a subset from the original dataset source.
Stored it on an external hard drive to manage storage constraints.
Uploaded a smaller working subset to Google Drive for processing in Google Colab.
2. Inspecting the Data
Before using the dataset, we performed an initial inspection to:

Verify file formats (ensure all files are valid .mp4 videos).
Detect corrupted files (videos that fail to open or have broken frames).
Remove mislabeled or unnecessary metadata to avoid bias.
3. Cleaning the Dataset
To prevent data leakage and ensure a fair evaluation, we:

Removed corrupted videos that could not be processed.
Anonymized filenames to prevent the model from learning patterns from names instead of content.
